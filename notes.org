#+title: Spacetorio Notes


* Past steps
- [X] Add Entt to the project
- [X] Create Entity Class wrapping all entt methods
- [X] Create the TransformComponent and recreate the planet entities into the spaceScene
- [X] render a basic universe view with a moving camera
- [X] add zoom to camera

- [X] Setup simple solar system
- [X] Setup basic biomes on Planets
- [X] Setup a simple spaceship player

- [X] Biome selection through mouse
  - [X] Setup basic collision detection system (Shapes class)
  - [X] Add ClickableComponent
  - [X] Add ColliderComponent (Active/Passive?)

- [X] Landing option on Biomes
  - [X] Detailed ground generation from lowRes biome data
  - [X] 2D Terraria-like tile system to place entities
  - [X] Scene switching system

- [X] Switch to OpenGL



* Next steps
- [ ] Block Interactions with mouse
  - [ ] Tiles digging (Right mouse hold)
  - [ ] Wall placing (Left click)

- [ ] Font rendering in OpenGL

- [ ] Basic Inventory system
  - [ ] Dropping tile on floor after digging
  - [ ] Picking up tiles from floor
  - [ ] Minimal custom UI

- [ ] RoomScene <-> BiomeScene swtiching
  - [ ] Room recognition system

- [ ] Add Plants on terrain

- [ ] Maybe try nuklear ?

* Entities
- [ ] Tile (Dirt, wood, concrete)
- [ ] Door
- [ ] Background Wall
- [ ] Chest



* Assets (for OpenGL)
- [X] Basic dirt Tiling
- [ ] Basic Player walking animation



* Side steps
- [ ] Universe minimap
- [ ] Planets orbiting their Sun in StarSystem
- [ ] Otimize biomes data by cropping the texture_space image



** Code Organization improvements
- Rework collider components to have only one component with different shapes






* OpenGL Stuff

** Instancing to batch together tiles in a single draw call
-

** Texture Atlas

** Other
- Use Vertex coordinates with world coordinates (so remains mostly fixed)
- Send the camera data as uniform to render the vertex in the proper screen position

** Pseudocode
*** Tile Data VBO
tileDataLayout = {
  32.0, 32.0,             //World Pos
   0.0,  0.0,  1.0,  1.0, //Texture Coordinates
}

*** Setup Renderer
genericTileVAO = init     (GL_STATIC_DRAW)
instancedTilesVBO = init  (GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW)

*** Render Loop
chunksToRender = calculate chunks in camera

//Update tilesDataVBO if necessary
if chunksToRender != previousChunks:
    amount = tiles in to render
    tilesDataVBO.size = amount * tileDataLayout.size

    for tile in tilesToRender:
        tilesDataVBO.data[i] = tile.worldPos, tile.textCoords

//Draw tiles
glBindBuffer(instancedTilesVBO)
glBindVertexArray(genericTileVAO)
glDrawArraysInstanced(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 6, amount)
